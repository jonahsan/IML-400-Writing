Reflection (9/11):
----------------
"As We May Think" is a popular article among IML classes. I remember the first time that I read it, I skipped the foreword, and didn't inform myself of any context. I was even ignorant as to who Vannevar Bush was. So as I read the article, I became somewhat confused by the seemingly dated vernacular, and the similarly dated ideas. I thought to myself "these devices already exist!" Soon enough, I did a quick google search, and made some significant discoveries. 

While it's interesting to compare Bush's [speculative devices][original article] with [the ones we use today][gopro], I think it's also important to consider the ethical dilemma that Bush faced as an [scientist, inventor, and administrator](http://www.doug-long.com/bush.htm). I bring this argument up because I think that as we develop ideas of speculative devices, as Bush did, we can get lost in our imaginations, engrossed in the process of making, and forget how they might effect the real world (Sennet, 6). 

The context surrounding this article is very interesting to me. Bush publishes this piece at a very important time in history. [Writing in July of 1945][original article], he shares his curiosity regarding the future of certain scientific fields, and inventions. He then goes on to speculate features and uses of future devices. Bush managed to hypothesize, speculative devices that possess striking resemblances to those that we use today; and he managed to do so by trying to solve problems that he noticed already arising during his time. It's unfortunately ironic, however, that the atomic bomb, [which Bush helped develop][manhattan project], would drop on Japan only a couple months later. 

As I reread "As We May Think" for IML 400, I began to compare it to another book I am reading called "The Craftsman" by Richard Sennet. In this book, Sennet speaks on what craftsmanship represents, as well as the responsibility that a craftsman takes on in his process of creating. In his prologue, he recounts his fascination with the ideas of [political theorist](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=hannah%20arendt), Hannah's Arendt, and her skeptical views of humans as *makers* and *thinkers*. According, to Sennet, Arendt believes that craftsman "don't understand what they are doing," and that “ it is human nature to believe that anything that seems possible should therefore be tried” (1,4). These ideas that Arendt professes can make one skeptical of a human's ability to positively influence society with their creations. Yet despite the guilt that Bush might have felt for his involvement with the development of a nuclear bomb, he retains an optimistic outlook for science and technology as he concludes "As We May Think"

> Yet, in the application of science to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.

Bush's optimism for science and technology is necessary, especially when the development of new devices can prove to be potentially dangerous because it demonstrates that "people can learn about themselves through the things that they make" (Sennet, 8).
