Everything is a Remix / Everyone is a Vessel

It's interesting how laws, such as SOPA and PIPA, which at the base, regard intellectual property and copyright, interplay with philosophy and creativity. After watching the few videos regarding the topics of copyright infringement, and remixing, I remembered a TED talk that I was introduced to a few weeks ago. 

The talk, titled ["Your Elusive Creative Genius](https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius), was given by Elizabeth Gilbert. Gilbert spoke at the event because of her experiences surrounding the success of her novel *Eat Pray Love*. After her novel became a best-seller she realized that she had to reshape her ideas of creativity in order to deal with the psychological and emotional stress of being an artist. This stress and anxiety, according to her, delves from the idea that *creativity comes from within,* that she is solely responsible for what she creates.  

This simple idea, that the individual possesses and owns his or her creativity, also seems to be the foundation of issues surrounding intellectual property. According to Gilbert, this idea arose in the renaissance, and prior to its inception, people, in ancient civilizations such as Rome and Greece, believed that occult forces drove creativity, and that people were merely vessels. So rather than considering some individuals as geniuses, this ideology extends the idea that everyone is a vessel and can experience creativity and inspiration.






As stated in [Everything is a Remix](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/), "creativity isn't magic," in fact is consists of three simple aspects: copy, compile, transform.
