Reflection (9/25):
---------------------------

This essay, by Tim Berners-Lee, et. al, acts as a sort of instruction manual for the World Wide Web. It's easy to comprehend what Berners-Lee is trying to convey as someone who has now grown up with the Internet, and as someone who has had comprehensive experience navigating and publishing on it. I imagine, however, that despite Berners-Lee's instruction manual, it was quite difficult to understand circa 1994. Now that I think of it, the concept of the World Wide Web could be considered tacit knowledge: 
>"The World-Wide Web (W3) was developed to be a pool of human knowledge...."

>"If you haven't yet experienced the Web, the best way to find out about it is to try it."

The Internet had just begun to become an interest of the public at the time of this essay. Being so new, it still represented a somewhat abstract idea. People outside of the tech realm spoke of it [vaguely][angelina], or [didn't quite grasp it at all][today-show]. Even as I think about it now, it would be very difficult to articulate what the Web is to someone who has very experienced it. 

I find this very interesting because it makes me wonder what sort of technologies are currently in their infancy, similar to how the World Wide Web was in 1994.
